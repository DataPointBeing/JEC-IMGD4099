I decided I liked the idea of reaction-diffusion as a biological process and wanted to focus on that aesthetically. Playing around with a few simulators, I grew to especially like the look of Karl Sims's, and also found a set of parameters that resulted in slow but very interesting growth. To me, the particular behavior almost seemed reminiscent of slime or a petri dish, so I decided to select that parameter set as a default state and created a fragment shader to reinforce a "science experiment" look with pleasant, glossy-looking light green chemical B, a subtle blue grid backdrop, and dithered drop shadows tinted the color of the chemical. I randomly seeded the board with sparse chemical B, so when the simulation is started and left to sit you can see the simulated cells grow larger and larger. I added a simple brush for adding additional chemical B, and settings for determining (noisy) chemical A to overlay with it, allowing for the often perfect concentric patterns created by a circular pen to be optionally broken up.

To add some additional visual interest to the simulation, I implemented an extra array used for storing a per-pixel **color** for each cell. The brush randomly colors each stroke in a pastel hue; cells will remember their color, and when adjacent to cells that have higher concentrations of B, they gradually inherit those cells' colors. This creates smooth blending when groups of cells make contact with one another. Clusters of a given color that touch open areas will thus pass their color to that area as they spread into it (due to having a far, far higher B value), meaning colors inherently propagate with their respective cell clusters through space.

My feedback was very positive. I had to guide them due to try clicking the canvas, as they didn't realize at first that they could; they also commented at first that the microbes seemed to form a strange amount of grainy-looking "squares", but this seemingly ended up being due to them selecting a very low value for Db right at the start and didn't happen repeatedly. They seemed to enjoy how the background highlighted the translucency of the simulation, and thought the colors and patterns produced by the system were impressive. They did seem held back by the lack of ability to configure the brush, so I added some settings after the fact to correct that (as well as improving the color blending algorithm).
